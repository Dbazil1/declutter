# Follow-up Issues

## 1. Keep Users Logged In When Refreshing

**Issue:** Users are logged out when refreshing the page, requiring them to log in again.

**Solution Implemented:** 
- Added localStorage-based authentication token storage
- Created functions to save/restore authentication tokens
- Added JavaScript components to check for tokens on page load

**Status:** Implemented but needs testing to confirm it works in production. If issues persist:
- Check token expiration handling
- Ensure token refresh mechanism is working correctly
- Verify that localStorage is accessible and not being cleared

## 2. Preserve Image Rotation on Upload

**Issue:** Images lose their original rotation/orientation when uploaded.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Add EXIF data processing to preserve orientation
- Use client-side image processing libraries (like exif-js) to read and apply orientation
- Add server-side image processing to preserve metadata
- Implement image preview with correct orientation before upload

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate image upload pipeline
- Test with different devices/browsers to confirm the issue
- Implement solution in the image upload component

## 3. Price Field Validation Error

**Issue:** Users get an error "price_usd must be less than or equal to 0" when creating items.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added validation to ensure at least one price field (USD or Local) has a value above 0
- Enhanced error handling to present a clear message when both prices are 0
- Fixed the validation logic in the add_item_form function

**Status:** Fixed by adding proper validation before submitting to the database.

## 4. Additional Issues to Consider

### 4.1 Mobile Responsiveness

**Issue:** UI components may not be properly optimized for mobile devices.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Test app on various mobile devices
- Optimize grid layouts with appropriate column counts based on screen size
- Ensure buttons and input fields are touch-friendly

### 4.2 Performance Optimization

**Issue:** App may load slowly, especially with many items or images.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Add pagination for large item lists
- Optimize database queries
- Cache frequently accessed data

### 4.3 Error Handling Improvements

**Issue:** Some errors may not provide clear guidance to users.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Add more specific error messages
- Implement structured error handling
- Add a debug mode toggle for developers

### 4.4 Accessibility Improvements

**Issue:** App may not be fully accessible to users with disabilities.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers
- Implement keyboard navigation

### 4.5 Data Backup Mechanism

**Issue:** Users need a way to backup/export their data.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Add export to CSV/JSON feature
- Implement regular automated backups
- Provide restore functionality
